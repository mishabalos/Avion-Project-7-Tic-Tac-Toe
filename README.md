# TIC TAC TOE 

#### A Tic Tac Toe game with dynamic turn tracking, a history of moves, and interactive buttons for navigating previous and next turns, plus a reset function that restarts the game and clears the move history.

### OBJECTIVE
Create a game of tic tac toe created with HTML, CSS, & Javascript 

### OVERVIEW 
This Tic-Tac-Toe project is a two-phased interactive web game designed with a focus on clean gameplay, responsiveness, and user-friendly controls. 

In Phase 1, the game logic was built around a two-dimensional array to represent the board, allowing users to take turns as X and O. The design, responsiveness, and player rules were implemented to ensure a seamless experience. 

Phase 2 introduced additional features like move history, where every turn is saved and users can navigate through previous moves using "Previous" and "Next" buttons. A reset button was also added to restart the game, hide the navigation buttons, and clear the move history.
